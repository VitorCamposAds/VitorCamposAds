### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Holding a Bachelor's and Mastrer's in humanities, my recent switch into pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development marks a significant step. This switch was spurred by the acknolegment that technology not only enhances our life quality, but also promotes broader access to knowledge, simplifies information exchange, dismantles communication barriers and fosters social inclusion. That being said, those reasons inspired me to pursue this path and master its underlying principles and tools.

My aspirations, however, extend beyond a mere career transition, as I perceive Information Technology as a powerful instrument for driving meaningful change: welfare promotion, issue resolution and awareness.

Driven by a passion for lifelong learning, I am constantly motivated to explore new horizons and deepen my knowledge. Thus, improve IT skills has become my main focus, and I am committed to dedicating myself to this goal.
