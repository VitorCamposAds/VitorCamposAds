### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Equipped with a Bachelor's and Master's in humanities, my recent transition into pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development signals a significant change. This change was spurred by the acknolegment that technology not only enhances our life quality, but also promotes broader access to knowledge, simplifies information exchange, dismantles communication barriers and fosters social inclusion. That being said, those reasons inspired me to follow this path through its inherent principles and tools.

My aspirations, however, extend beyond a mere career change, as I perceive Information Technology as a powerful instrument for driving meaningful change:  welfare promotion, issue resolution and awareness.

Driven by a passion for lifelong learning, I am constantly motivated to explore new horizons and deepen my knowledge. Consequently, mastering skills intrinsic to IT has become my main focus, and I am fully committed to dedicated study and hard work in order to achieve this goal.
