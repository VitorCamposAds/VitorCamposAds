### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Possessing a Bachelor's and Master's in humanities, I have recently started a sudden change by 
enrolling myself within the Analysis and Systems Development Degree. Nevertheless, the turning point 
hit me when I realized that technology not only enhances life quality, but also eases access to knowledge, 
simplifies information exchange, breaks down communication barriers, and promotes social inclusion. 
That is so to say, is the main reason why I wanted to embrace these premises and tools.

My aspirations, however, goes beyond simply seeking a new professional career, 
as I perceive Information Technology as an excellent path 
to input significant impact: 
promote well-being, problem resolution, and raise awareness.

Learning is what moves me, 
so exploring new horizons is what propels me to continue 
studying and deepening my knowledge.
